# Colorizing-the-Prokudin-Gorskii-Collection

The images given from the Prokudin-Gorskii Collection consist of sets of three images, corresponding to the different color channels. The purpose of this project is to automatically crop the color channel images, align and combine them in order to get a color image. The result is shown in the images below. More images and information about the collection can be found here -> http://www.loc.gov/pictures/collection/prok .
